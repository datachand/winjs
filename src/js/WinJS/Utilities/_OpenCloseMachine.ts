// This module provides a state machine which is designed to be used by controls which need to
// open, close, and fire related events (e.g. beforeopen, afterclose). The state machine handles
// many edge cases. For example, what happens if:
//  - open is called when we're already opened?
//  - close is called while we're in the middle of opening?
//  - dispose is called while we're in the middle of firing beforeopen?
// The state machine takes care of all of these edge cases so that the control doesn't have to.
// The control is responible for knowing how to play its open/close animations and update its DOM.
// The state machine is responsible for ensuring that these things happen at the appropriate times.
// This module is broken up into 3 major pieces:
//   - OpenCloseMachine: Controls should instantiate one of these. The machine keeps track of the
//     current state and has methods for forwarding calls to the current state.
//   - IOpenCloseControl: Controls must provide an object which implements this interface. The
//     interface gives the machine hooks for invoking the control's open and close animations.
//   - States: The various states (e.g. Closed, Opened, Opening) that the machine can be in. Each
//     implements IOpenCloseState.

// Example usage:
//   class MyControl {
//       element: HTMLElement;
//       private _machine: OpenCloseMachine;
//
//       constructor(element?: HTMLElement, options: any = {}) {
//           this.element = element || document.createElement("div");
//
//           // Create the machine.
//           this._machine = new OpenCloseMachine({
//               eventElement: this.element,
//               onOpen: (): Promise<any> => {
//                   // Do the work to render the contol in its opened state with an animation.
//                   // Return the animation promise.
//               },
//               onClose: (): Promise<any> => {
//                   // Do the work to render the contol in its closed state with an animation.
//                   // Return the animation promise.
//               },
//               onUpdateDom() {
//                   // Do the work to render the internal state of the control to the DOM. If a
//                   // control restricts all its DOM modifications to onUpdateDom, the state machine
//                   // can guarantee that the control won't modify its DOM while it is animating.
//               },
//               onUpdateDomWithIsOpened: (isOpened: boolean ) => {

// Implementing the control as a state machine helps us correctly handle:
//   - re-entrancy while firing events
//   - calls into the control during asynchronous operations (e.g. animations)
//
// Many of the states do their "enter" work within a promise chain. The idea is that if
// the state is interrupted and exits, the rest of its work can be skipped by canceling
// the promise chain.
// An interesting detail is that anytime the state may trigger app code (e.g. due to
// firing an event), the current promise must end and a new promise must be chained off of it.
// This is necessary because the app code may interact with the control and cause it to
// change states. If we didn't create a new promise, then the very next line of code that runs
// after triggering app code may not be valid because the state may have exited. Starting a
// new promise after each triggering of app code prevents us from having to worry about this
// problem. In this configuration, when a promise's success handler runs, it guarantees that
// the state hasn't exited.
// For similar reasons, each of the promise chains created in "enter" starts off with a _Signal
// which is completed at the end of the "enter" function (this boilerplate is abstracted away by
// the "interruptible" function). The reason is that we don't want any of the code in "enter"
// to run until the promise chain has been stored in a variable. If we didn't do this (e.g. instead,
// started the promise chain with Promise.wrap()), then the "enter" code could trigger the "exit"
// function (via app code) before the promise chain had been stored in a variable. Under these
// circumstances, the promise chain would be uncancelable and so the "enter" work would be
// unskippable. This wouldn't be good when we needed the state to exit early.

// These two functions manage interruptible work promises (one creates them the other cancels
// them). They communicate with each other thru the _interruptibleWorkPromises property which
//  "interruptible" creates on your object.
